                <p>
                    Back in 2012, I decided to try my hand at creating custom
                    Tumblr themes and tumbled head first into the rabbit hole of
                    coding and web development. Fast-forward to today, and I’ve
                    had the privilege of building software for an advertising
                    agency, a start-up, a student-led design studio, and a huge
                    corporation.
                </p>

                <p>
                    My main focus these days is building products and leading
                    projects for our clients at Upstatement. In my free time
                    I've also released an online video course that covers
                    everything you need to know to build a web app with the
                    Spotify API.

                    When I’m not at the computer, I’m usually rock climbing,
                    hanging out with my wife and two cats, or running around

                            I have a strong foundation in HTML and CSS. I use
                            HTML to define the content and structure of my
                            websites, while CSS enables me to style and

                            Laravel is a popular open-source PHP framework that
                            follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC)
                            architectural pattern. It provides an expressive and
                            intuitive syntax, making it enjoyable for developers
                            to work with. Laravel offers a wide range of
                            built-in features and tools for routing, caching,
                            authentication, and database management, allowing
