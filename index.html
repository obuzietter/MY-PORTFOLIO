        <p>
          Back in 2012, I decided to try my hand at creating custom Tumblr
          themes and tumbled head first into the rabbit hole of coding and web
          development. Fast-forward to today, and I’ve had the privilege of
          building software for an advertising agency, a start-up, a student-led
          design studio, and a huge corporation.
        </p>

        <p>
          My main focus these days is building products and leading projects for
          our clients at Upstatement. In my free time I've also released an
          online video course that covers everything you need to know to build a
          web app with the Spotify API.

        <p>
          When I’m not at the computer, I’m usually rock climbing, hanging out
          with my wife and two cats, or running around Hyrule searching for
          Korok seeds

              I have a strong foundation in HTML and CSS. I use HTML to define
              the content and structure of my websites, while CSS enables me to
              style and customize the layout, colors, and typography.

            <p>
              I leverage JavaScript's power to enhance the interactivity and
              functionality of my websites. Whether it's implementing dynamic
              features, validating forms, or making AJAX requests, I utilize
              JavaScript to create responsive and engaging user experiences.

              state management, routing, and lifecycle methods to build
              interactive and efficient web applications.

              Laravel is a popular open-source PHP framework that follows the

              expressive and intuitive syntax, making it enjoyable for
              developers to work with. Laravel offers a wide range of built-in
              features and tools for routing, caching, authentication, and
